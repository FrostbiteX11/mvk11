# AGTEK Gradework & Civil Estimation Projects – mvk11

Welcome to my project repository showcasing the AGTEK Gradework models, takeoffs, and civil construction estimation work I’ve completed as part of my freelance career. I’m a **Civil Construction Estimator and Earthwork Modeler** working with clients globally through [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d9966166e7b7eaf6).

## 💼 Freelance Estimation & Modeling Services

As a freelancer, I specialize in **cut/fill volume calculations, site grading models, and earthwork takeoffs** using **AGTEK Gradework** software. I’ve collaborated with contractors, estimators, and construction managers on a wide range of projects, including commercial pads, residential subdivisions, coffee shops, and infrastructure upgrades.

### My Services Include:
- Accurate 3D grading models
- Volume takeoff reports (in Excel/CSV)
- Balanced site grading visualizations
- Subgrade preparation and export/import analysis
- Utility and paving quantity summaries
- Site logistics and preconstruction visualization

I support **onsite and offsite scopes**, including demolition, trenching, stormwater, sewer, fire lines, paving, and erosion control.

📬 I’m available for **freelance hire** via my [Upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d9966166e7b7eaf6) and open to short-term or long-term engagements.
